  	<p> Unity is of utmost importance for society as well as the whole country. “Strength is always with Unity” is a popular phrase and it is true to its every word. Unity represents togetherness. Therefore, it is standing together for every thick and thin matter. There are many stories as well as real-life incidences have proved that unity always leads a harmonious and fulfilling life for all. On the other hand, many people still do not understand the importance of staying in unity. People keep fighting over insignificant things and at last end up with loneliness.
<br>
Here are some of the advantages of unity:
<br>
People help each other and provide moral as well as financial support when it is needed. On the other hand, living in isolation will make anyone feel insecure and introvert.<br>
It is a proven fact that when we stay united then we may seek guidance from others them for both personal and professional matters.<br>
Staying united is good for our growth as well as the nation’s development. This is also good for the family in particular and all-round development of children.<br>When we work together, we are motivated and encouraged to work harder. Also, we push each other to accomplish the goals and this works as a great motivational factor.<br>When we work together as a team, we are able to accomplish greater goals which might not be possible alone.<br>Fighting a mission becomes much easier when there are more numbers of people involved. Indian national movement for freedom is it’s the best example. Many social evils and unjust practices have been fought and eradicated in the past only because of unity among people.<br>Thus, we see there are uncountable benefits of staying in unity. We can accomplish big tasks, rely on the people in times of need and nurture youth power in a better way. Safety and security can be assured by the national unity. Every citizen must work towards having full unity in the country.
